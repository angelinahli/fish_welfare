The main problem, however, is the high mortality rate observed during paralarval rearing, making successful juvenile settlement still very difficult to achieve. Unfortunately, despite the high knowledge on the biology and ethology of this species, there are many other aspects to be solved from a welfare perspective. For instance, the current farming systems result in high stress in O. vulgaris due to spatial constraint, high densities and sociability, which consequently increase aggression (cannibalism and autophagy) at different life stages. In addition, octopus skin is particularly sensitive and can be easily damaged during handling, transportation or stressful confinement conditions. A humane slaughtering protocol is not yet established, since the nature and degree of any suffering during current practices are unknown. O. vulgaris appears capable of experiencing pain and suffering, exhibits cognitive complexity and sophisticated behavioural patterns which can be interpreted and serve as indicator of the welfare status.", "link_profile": "http://fishethobase.net/db/28/shortprofile/", "home_range_li": "low", "home_range_po": "low", "home_range_ce": "high", "depth_range_li": "low", "depth_range_po": "middle", "depth_range_ce": "high", "migration_li": "low", "migration_po": "middle", "migration_ce": "middle", "reproduction_li": "low", "reproduction_po": "middle", "reproduction_ce": "middle", "aggregation_li": "low", "aggregation_po": "low", "aggregation_ce": "high", "aggression_li": "low", "aggression_po": "low", "aggression_ce": "middle", "substrate_li": "low", "substrate_po": "high", "substrate_ce": "middle", "stress_li": "low", "stress_po": "middle", "stress_ce": "middle", "malformation_li": "nofindings", "malformation_po": "unclear", "malformation_ce": "nofindings", "slaughter_li": "unclear", "slaughter_po": "low", "slaughter_ce": "middle", "fishethoscore_li": "0", "fishethoscore_po": "1", "fishethoscore_ce": "3"}, {"link_summary": "http://fishethobase.net/db/21/", "name_latin": "Litopenaeus vannamei", "name_english": "Pacific whiteleg shrimp", "sp_id": "pacificwhitelegshrimp", "description": "Like other farmed shrimp species, the Pacific whiteleg shrimp\u00a0belongs to the Penaeides family within the order of\u00a0Decapoda.

Their origin lays in the Mediterranean and in the Eastern Atlantic from the British Isles to the Cape Verde and the Canary Islands to the coasts of Senegal. Apart from the sea, Gilthead seabram can be found also in the brackish water of estuaries.\nAdult animals reach an overall length of 26 to 70 cm and a weight of 300 g to 4 kg. Body length and weight are hereditary. Gilthead seabream get 12 years old at the maximum; they reach sexual maturity in the first or second year of their life. The role of body\u2019s colouring for mating is not clear; anyhow the intensity of the colours increases from July to October, then fading again in males while persisting in females until spawning.\nThe spawning season lasts from October to March with a peak in December and a tail towards the summer, depending on environmental conditions. Females spawn in large groups. Over a couple of days or even months they spawn ten thousands of eggs daily the weight of which corresponds to half or even twice their body weight. In captivity spawning can be triggered also in other seasons by raising water temperature.\nGilthead seabream are hermaphrodites that first evolve as males, later either morphing into females or living on as males. Sex conversion can also be induced by adding young animals to the group which causes older males to convert into females.\nGilthead seabream linger at the surface and in depths to 30, rarely 150 metres; by day they swim deeper than at night. They grow better in water temperatures around 25 \u00b0C, whereas temperatures below 11 \u00b0C or above 30 \u00b0C do not agree with them. For the summer season they migrate to bays and estuaries. When around winter the temperatures are decreasing they move back to the open sea where they were born. Aside from this seasonal alternation Gilthead seabream live relatively sedentary with a daily radius seeming to be less than 1 kilometre.\nGilthead seabream are rather diurnal and move around in schools, swimming less at night and eventually even burying themselves in the sand for rest. Big individuals however behave exactly contrariwise, being most active at night, presumably as they are solitary. Typically Gilthead seabream swim with a velocity of half a body length per second; on the run they can swim up to seven times as fast.\nGilthead seabream seem to like seaweed bottom best; yet they can also be found on sandy, gravely or rocky grounds or in estuaries with salt marshes or muddy bottom. They are mainly carnivorous, feeding predominantly on krill and worms and occasionally fry, less frequently on algae and other plants. In winter they feed in the dusk, in summer in the morning or towards evening. They fetch their prey by carving their head partly into the bottom.\nGilthead seabream are sensitive to light; manipulation of day/night-rhythm disagrees with them. They communicate through knocking and pulsed sounds produced by contracting sonic muscles that excite their swim bladder. They either live in small groups with linear hierarchy or in big anonymous schools; big individuals live also solitary. Dominant animals occupy the area of food and show more activity and aggressivity than the subordinates who either escape upwards or hardly move and stay away from food.\n", "link_profile": "http://fishethobase.net/db/49/shortprofile/", "home_range_li": "low", "home_range_po": "high", "home_range_ce": "high", "depth_range_li": "low", "depth_range_po": "middle", "depth_range_ce": "middle", "migration_li": "low", "migration_po": "low", "migration_ce": "high", "reproduction_li": "unclear", "reproduction_po": "nofindings", "reproduction_ce": "low", "aggregation_li": "unclear", "aggregation_po": "middle", "aggregation_ce": "middle", "aggression_li": "unclear", "aggression_po": "low", "aggression_ce": "middle", "substrate_li": "unclear", "substrate_po": "middle", "substrate_ce": "low", "stress_li": "low", "stress_po": "low", "stress_ce": "middle", "malformation_li": "unclear", "malformation_po": "low", "malformation_ce": "high", "slaughter_li": "low", "slaughter_po": "middle", "slaughter_ce": "middle", "fishethoscore_li": "0", "fishethoscore_po": "1", "fishethoscore_ce": "3"}, {"link_summary": "http://fishethobase.net/db/18/", "name_latin": "Hippoglossus hippoglossus", "name_english": "Atlantic halibut", "sp_id": "atlantichalibut", "filename_image": "atlantichalibut.jpg", "description": "Hippoglossus hippoglossus is a slow growing, cold water flatfish\u00a0that can reach up to nearly 5 m and over 300 kg.

Wild Atlantic salmon live off the coasts of the Northern Atlantic ocean, along the USA and Canada and from Portugal to Scandinavia and up to Southern Greenland and Iceland, as well as in more than 2000 bordering rivers. They have been introduced to the Bering Sea. They can reach a maximum age of 13 years, a maximum weight of 47 kg and a maximum length of 150 cm (male) or 120 cm (female). The common length is 38 cm. It seems that growth increases with decreasing population density, but more studies are needed to be sure.\nAtlantic salmon spawn in the upper course of rivers between October and January.\u00a0In the first summer of their lifes, fry develop into \u201cparr\u201d and live in their river of origin for at least 1 and up to 5 years, extending their home range up- or downstream from less than 100 metres to several kilometres as they grow. Finally they adapt to seawater in spring, transmuting into \u201csmolt\". Subsequently they migrate to the sea where they live as adults for up to 4 years. After all, they wander back upstream in winter as \u201cgrilse\" to their birthplace for spawning. Exhausted by this journey, most adults die; only a few called \u201ckelt\u201d make it a second time.\nIt is still speculative how Atlantic salmon manage to home exactly to their place of birth. It could be by an interaction of sensing the magnetic field and an imprint of the scent of the water in either the olfactory system or the lateral line or both.\nAtlantic salmon establish dominance hierarchies already at the fry stage. Dominant individuals are highly active in places with food abundance and show aggressiveness towards subordinates, the latter swimming upwards, hardly moving and staying away from food. In the wild, parr are territorial and occupy habitat with high drift rates and low densities. Older parr tend to stay farther from the shore and from the bottom in order to enhance food availability. Younger parr on the other hand have to be satisfied with suboptimal feeding grounds where in return predator risk is reduced. It seems that increasing density increases the frequency or severity of aggression, but other factors may play a role, too.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\nIn rivers, smolt swim passively downstream most of the time, head first. This is also their escape movement if there is no other way out. In streams, adults reach a net ground speed of 0.2 to 28 km per day whereas in the sea they move about 15 to 30 km per day. To keep buoyancy, Atlantic salmon swallow air during jumping over the water surface.\nIn the wild, the individually required patrol space increases with age. Juveniles seam to swim <0.1 km (up- or downstream), older parr several km, smolt up to 1800 km to the sea, depending on habitat and barriers. The preferred depth ranges from 10 to 60 cm, but if the habitat allows for, Atlantic salmon swim as deep as 6.5 m or even deeper. Under farm conditions, adults were observed to use the full depth available, down to 15 m. Individuals dive deep to withdraw from abrupt light changes, intensive light, sounds, or predators. In order to dive, Atlantic salmon deflate their swim bladder and re-fill it afterwards.\n\n\u00a0\nPreferences for various substrates, water velocities, water temperatures and patrol space differ remarkably. Generally, Atlantic salmon are opportunistic in substrate choice, but avoid fine material like sand and mud. Most parr prefer larger stones as shelter but make use also of aquatic plants, overhanging vegetation or deadwood. Parr shelter individually and do not share a shelter they found.\nAtlantic salmon typically live in water temperatures between 0 and 20\u00a0\u00b0C with preferences between 4 and 18 \u00b0C, a swimming optimum at 16-17 \u00b0C and a growth optimum at 14-19 \u00b0C. They reduce or stop feeding below 6-7 \u00b0C or switch to nocturnal feeding. They potentially survive lower (rivers with ice cover) or higher temperatures if they can divert to water levels with different temperatures or have shelter. The main problem of ice cover in rivers is that it decreases the winter habitat area and that it reduces the spawning season.\nJuveniles avoid habitats with an average column velocity below 3 cm per second whereas they prefer velocities above 6 cm per second. With decreasing water temperatures, Atlantic salmon try to avoid higher flow velocities in riffles and runs.\nAtlantic salmon are predominantly carnivorous, feeding on invertebrates, mainly on aquatic insects. The prey of the different life stages overlaps generally, but younger Atlantic salmon feed rather on smaller, older rather on larger species. In the wild, parr feed as well on benthic as on drift prey.\nAtlantic salmon are diurnal. Foraging by sight, they are less active and less territorial in the dark and tend to rest at night. Juveniles and adults move deeper in the water column during day than during night, probably to avoid intensive daylight. Nocturnal activity is occasionally observed at low temperatures. Smolt however migrate at night, probably to avoid predators.\nAtlantic salmon are sensitive to blue-green light. In cages, they dive away to the bottom to escape blue light of low intensity at night whereas they swim furiously at higher light intensity. Infrasound or slapping on the water surface leads to increased swimming and diving.\nFor spawning, temperatures must be above 10 \u00b0C for 3 months and should not exceed 20 \u00b0C except for a few weeks. Females avoid fine substrate and prefer grain size of up to 10% of body size. The female cuts one redd on average by repeated flexures of her body. She deposits up to 450 eggs 15-25 cm deep in the gravel to protect them from light, predators and high flow rate. The dominant male chases rivals away from the spawning site.\n", "link_profile": "http://fishethobase.net/db/1/shortprofile/", "home_range_li": "low", "home_range_po": "low", "home_range_ce": "middle", "depth_range_li": "unclear", "depth_range_po": "high", "depth_range_ce": "middle", "migration_li": "low", "migration_po": "low", "migration_ce": "high", "reproduction_li": "low", "reproduction_po": "middle", "reproduction_ce": "middle", "aggregation_li": "unclear", "aggregation_po": "nofindings", "aggregation_ce": "low", "aggression_li": "low", "aggression_po": "middle", "aggression_ce": "middle", "substrate_li": "low", "substrate_po": "middle", "substrate_ce": "high", "stress_li": "low", "stress_po": "middle", "stress_ce": "middle", "malformation_li": "low", "malformation_po": "middle", "malformation_ce": "middle", "slaughter_li": "high", "slaughter_po": "high", "slaughter_ce": "high", "fishethoscore_li": "1", "fishethoscore_po": "2", "fishethoscore_ce": "3"}, {"link_summary": "http://fishethobase.net/db/40/", "name_latin": "Salvelinus alpinus alpinus", "name_english": "Arctic char", "sp_id": "arcticchar", "filename_image": "arcticchar.jpg", "description": "Salvelinus alpinus alpinus is a highly plastic and very resilient freshwater fish.
